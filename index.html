<!-- (A note from Lesson 57 (Project 1 Posters)):
In Project 1, the CSS definition for 'v-cloak' as a CSS class is in
/public/style.css
which is loaded just above, *prior* to the v-cloak invocation.
Bon.
-->
<!-- LESSON 121 from Project 2 Vue-Cinema
Here in Project 2 we see that SCSS is used, with Webpack
(more sophisticated), but this approach means the CSS (defining 'v-cloak')
is *not* loaded before the line like the one below.
So - the fix here in Project 2 is to hard-code a bit of style definition
in the index.html page head. No biggie. Cheers.

    <!--  Only root instance data that needs to be sent down to Overview component. I think...
    Hmm, here's another (the movies!) << NO!
    Hmm again - mebbe not?! -->

<!-- Now handled by router-view:
    <overview
            v-bind:day="day"
    v-bind:my-bus="myBus"></overview>
-->
    <!--  N.B. (!) Here in router-view, still need to v-bind properties to attributes to pass down.
     Only little downside:
     1) These props will go to Any and All components put in here by router-view.
     (right now we only have one Component: Overview.vue)
     2) "What if user comes direct to that URL?" (they wouldn't get your props)
     Again, for us, with this super-simple case, doesn't affect things. hmm.
     Hmm.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37937262/passing-props-to-vue-js-components-instantiated-by-vue-router

    <!-- LESSON 120 KEEP-ALIVE Tells vue-router to *not* destroy "stuff" (?) made upon routing ... (hmm)
    https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#keep-alive
    "caches the inactive component instances without destroying them."

*** WITH *** <keep-alive> : You get "inactive" router-view shown
N.B. This appears AFTER you have clicked on a link to go to the 2nd router-view option.
After you have clicked through on a Detail page.

    VUE DEV TOOL:
    OVERVIEW PAGE:
    http://localhost:8000/#/
    <Root>
      <Overview> == $vm0 (router-view)
      <Detail> (grayed back: router-view inactive)

    DETAIL PAGE:
    http://localhost:8000/#/movie/tt1172203
    <Root>
      <Overview> == $vm0 (grayed back: router-view inactive)
      <Detail> (router-view: /movie/:id)
***

Without <keep-alive>: No "inactive" shown; doesn't exist. Cheers.
